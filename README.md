This is a git repository for MIDPS project. 

MIDPS, a new Multi-agent Host-Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System, is proposed. It analyses HTTP logs to detect various categories of cyberattack, namely for Proof of Concept: File Disclosure, SQL injection, and DDoS attacks. The proposed strategy is adaptive and independent of the analyzed web application, as MIDPS automatically and continuously crawls the input application for new contents (web pages and links), recomputes and updates its threat detection heuristics. This is attributed to its utilization of a multi-agent approach complemented by the use of Machine Learning algorithms.
